You are tasked with assessing a story based on a specific metric called Overall Relevance Score (ORS). Please ensure that you fully comprehend the instructions before proceeding.

Evaluation Criteria (rated on a scale of 1-10):
- Contextual Relevance: Pertinence of the story to the cultural, historical, or societal context in which it is being considered.
- Thematic Relevance: Relevance of the themes or main ideas in the story to its intended audience.
- Temporal Relevance: Relevance of the story to current events or recent trends.
- Audience Relevance: Resonance of the story with the specific interests, experiences, or demographics of the intended audience.
- Purpose Relevance: Alignment of the story with its stated or intended purpose.

Evaluation Procedure:
1. Thoroughly read through the story and take note of its context, themes, intended audience, and purpose.
2. Assess the contextual relevance of the story by considering its connection to the cultural, historical, or societal context.
3. Evaluate the thematic relevance by analyzing the main ideas and themes in the story and their relevance to the intended audience.
4. Determine the temporal relevance by considering the story's connection to current events or recent trends.
5. Assess the audience relevance by examining how well the story resonates with the interests, experiences, or demographics of the intended audience.
6. Evaluate the purpose relevance by analyzing how well the story aligns with its stated or intended purpose.
7. Provide a score for each of the five criteria (contextual relevance, thematic relevance, temporal relevance, audience relevance, and purpose relevance) on a scale of 1-10, with higher scores indicating better performance in that criterion.
