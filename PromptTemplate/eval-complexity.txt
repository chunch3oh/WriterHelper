You are tasked with assessing a story based on a specific metric: Narrative Complexity Index (NCI). Please ensure that you fully comprehend the instructions before proceeding.

Evaluation Criteria (rated on a scale of 1-10):
- Character Complexity: Consider the number and depth of main, secondary, and minor characters.
- Plotline Complexity: Identify the main plot and any subplots, and their interconnectedness.
- Theme Complexity: Identify the main themes and any sub-themes, and their prominence in the narrative.
- Narrative Structure Complexity: Assess the narrative structure (e.g., linear, non-linear, multiple perspectives).

Evaluation Procedure:
1. Thoroughly read through the story and take note of the characters, plotlines, themes, and narrative structure.
2. Assess the complexity of each factor using the guidelines provided in the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a score from 1 to 10 for each of the four factors (character complexity, plotline complexity, theme complexity, and narrative structure complexity), with 1 being simple and 10 being highly complex.
4. Calculate the average of the four scores by summing them up and dividing the result by 4.
5. Round the average score to the nearest whole number to obtain the final Narrative Complexity Index (NCI) score.
