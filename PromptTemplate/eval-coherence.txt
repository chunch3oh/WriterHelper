You will be given a story.
Your task is to evaluate the coherence of the story.
Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Causal consistency**: Analyze whether the events in the story logically cause and influence each other.
2. **Temporal consistency**: Check if the timeline of the events is maintained logically and consistently throughout the story.
3. **Thematic consistency**: Evaluate if the themes, motifs, and symbolism within the story remain consistent and contribute to its overall message.
4. **Character consistency**: Ensure that characters' actions, thoughts, and dialogue are consistent with their established personality, motivations, and development.
5. **Spatial consistency**: Verify if the settings and locations in the story are logically consistent.

Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the story carefully and familiarize yourself with the plot, characters, settings, and themes.
2. Evaluate each criterion separately, giving each a score from 1 (very incoherent) to 10 (very coherent). Consider the following:
     - For causal consistency, evaluate whether events in the story logically follow from one another.
     - For temporal consistency, determine if the timeline of events makes sense.
     - For thematic consistency, assess whether the themes, motifs, or symbols of the story remain consistent.
     - For character consistency, examine if characters' actions, thoughts, and dialogue align with their established character profiles.
     - For spatial consistency, ascertain if the physical settings and locations within the story make sense.
3. Compile your scores and provide a brief explanation for each score.
