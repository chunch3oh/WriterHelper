Thematic consistency: 9
Character consistency: 8
Spatial consistency: 8
Average Score: 8.4

Explanation:

1. Causal consistency (8/10): The events in the story seem to follow a logical pattern. The protagonist's actions lead to natural consequences, such as Arthur discovering the true nature of the alien world and the war that results from it. However, the cause for the alien world's decision to secretly invade Earth could be better developed.

2. Temporal consistency (9/10): The timeline of events in the story appears to be consistent. The story progresses through the protagonistâ€™s adventures, discoveries, and the war with the alien world consistently.

3. Thematic consistency (9/10): The themes of adventure, discovery, friendship, and peace are consistently developed throughout the story. These themes emerge through the protagonist's interactions with other characters and their quest for the truth.

4. Character consistency (8/10): The protagonist, Arthur, remains consistently brave, intelligent, and curious throughout the story. Supporting characters, such as Kora and Leena, also have consistent motivations and actions. However, the motivations behind the alien world's invasion of Earth could be better explained for better character consistency.

5. Spatial consistency (8/10): The story establishes the two primary settings: Earth and the alien world. Descriptions of the alien lifeforms and world are provided, but more details about specific locations within the alien world would further enhance spatial consistency.

Overall, the story is quite coherent, averaging an 8.4 out of 10. The causal, spatial, and character consistency could be improved slightly by providing more context for the aliens' motivations and elaborating on certain settings within the alien world.
