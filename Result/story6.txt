Average Score: 8

Causal consistency (8): The story presents a logical series of events, where the protagonist's journey is guided by a mysterious signal that helps him uncover the secrets of a lost civilization while gaining a special power. However, there is a lack of detail regarding how some events are specifically connected.

Temporal consistency (8): The timeline of the events is mostly consistent, following the protagonist’s journey from the beginning to the end of the adventure. However, there are instances, such as the protagonist escaping the experimental world, where the passage of time is unclear.

Thematic consistency (9): The story maintains strong consistency in themes such as mystery, adventure, teamwork, and protecting society from an ancient threat. It successfully ties the protagonist's personal development together with the overarching theme of the lost civilization.

Character consistency (8): The protagonist's actions, thoughts, and journey are consistent with their character development and motivations. However, other characters with unique abilities are introduced towards the end of the story, and there is limited information about their personalities and motivations.

Spatial consistency (7): While the story takes place in different settings, such as the lost civilization's experimental site and the modern city, there is a lack of sufficient detail to fully establish these locations as coherent and well-defined.

Overall, the story maintains a solid level of coherence across the different criteria, with some room for improvement in aspects like causal connections between events and providing more details on settings and secondary characters.
